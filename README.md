# Image Classification Using Random Forest 

## Overview
This project implements an image classification system using Random Forest and SVM.  
The model classifies images into five classes: *dalmatian, dollar_bill, pizza, soccer_ball, sunflower*.

The notebook includes:
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Random Forest model with GridSearchCV
- Model evaluation (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score)
- Confusion matrix and feature importance plots
- Prediction on new images


## Dataset
The dataset contains 309 images across 5 classes.  
All images were resized to **64×64**, normalized, and flattened into feature vectors.

## How to Run
1. Open the notebook in Google Colab  
2. Upload `images.zip` when prompted  
3. Run all cells  
4. Optionally upload a new image for prediction
